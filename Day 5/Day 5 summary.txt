2.Scaffold :- Widget to design canvas and capable of creating widget inside it whereas default scaffold is white.
3.Scaffold contains almost everything you need to create a functional and responsive apps.
3.The body is a Text placed in a Center in order to center the text within the Scaffold. 
4. Inside the container we can use various other things such as color,decoration,child,width, height to make our app attractive.
5.Decoration : Decoration is used to change the look of the boundary created by container.We can't use decoration and colour together because decoration have there own color property.
6. Color :- Color is used to change the color.
7.Width and height :- adjust width and height on the screen (how much area should be covered on the screen according to the given input).
8.Boxdecoration function and setting the colour , text and image in side the box.If we want to create boxes we can use  layout function instead of Boxdecoration function.
9.we can create container inside the container as per our requirement.
10.  To overcome the limitation of container,we used column.In column () we can use multiple Child (children) , column supports the list.
11. If the requirement is to keep multiple things in an application , so we can use column widget in place of container.
12.Border Radius:- The border-radius property is used to round the corners of an element
13.ImageNetwork Function :- Display images from the internet.To work with images from a URL, use the Image.network().
