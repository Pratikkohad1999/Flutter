1. In today's session we got to know about  variables and its use cases,
Use of var, return keyword, different datatype used in dart language and 
Use cases of list and map.
2. Variables is  used to allocate memory location in computer memory that holds a value for that variable. This value can be changed during the execution of the program. 
3.A variable without value has null value by default. There are basically int, double, boolean and string  Data Types in Dart.
4. Var is a keyword that can  hold any type of variable value whether it is string,int or double .
5.In Dart, there is return keyword allows a function to return value. 
6.A List is simply an ordered group of objects.Dart represents arrays in the form of List objects.
7.Each element in the List is given a unique number called the index. The index starts from zero.
8. List is mutable means you can change their content without changing their identity.EX:- var x = [1,"Hello","Pratik"];
9. Just like List, Map(dynamic collection) is also a type of collection in which  data is stored in key: value pairs.Use of comma at the end of key-value pair for autoformat of the code. ex:-var details = {"Roll no":1,"Name":"Pratik"}; 
10.DartPad is an online interpreter to  run and compile the dart code.
11.When we save the code,the code get auto formated.
12. Internallinkedhashmap<String,Object> :- A hash-table based implementation of Map.
13. Runtime.type: checking variable type in Dart.
